# Weather App

A simple weather app using data from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://home.openweathermap.org/).



### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search the weather by entering a city name in search field.
- If city name exists, the app will show city's current temperature, humidity and wind speed.
